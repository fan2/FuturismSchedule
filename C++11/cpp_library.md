## [C standard library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library)
The **C standard library** or **libc** is the standard library for the [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), as specified in the [ANSI C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C) standard.
Since ANSI C was adopted by the [International Organization for Standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization), the C standard library is also called the **ISO C library**.
The C standard library provides [macros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)), type definitions and functions for tasks such as [string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_string_(computer_science)) handling, mathematical computations, input/output processing, [memory management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management), and several other [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) services.

### Header Files
The [application programming interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) (API) of the C standard library is declared in a number of [header files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_file). Each header file contains one or more function declarations, data type definitions, and macros.

After a long period of stability, three new header files (`iso646.h`, `wchar.h`, and `wctype.h`) were added with *Normative Addendum 1* (NA1), an addition to the C Standard ratified in 1995. Six more header files (`complex.h`, `fenv.h`, `inttypes.h`, `stdbool.h`, `stdint.h`, and `tgmath.h`) were added with [C99](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99), a revision to the C Standard published in 1999, and five more files (`stdalign.h`, `stdatomic.h`, `stdnoreturn.h`, `threads.h`, and `uchar.h`) with [C11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_(C_standard_revision)) in 2011. In total, there are now 29 header files.
