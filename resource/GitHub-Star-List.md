## Networking
### [CocoaAsyncSocket](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaAsyncSocket)
CocoaAsyncSocket provides easy-to-use and powerful asynchronous socket libraries for Mac and iOS. The classes are described below.

#### TCP
**`GCDAsyncSocket`** is a TCP/IP socket networking library built atop _Grand Central Dispatch_. Here are the key features available:

#### UDP
**`GCDAsyncUdpSocket`** is a UDP/IP socket networking library built atop _Grand Central Dispatch_. Here are the key features available:

### [CocoaHTTPServer](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaHTTPServer)
A small, lightweight, embeddable HTTP server for Mac OS X or iOS applications

#### [RoutingHTTPServer](https://github.com/mattstevens/RoutingHTTPServer)
Adds a Sinatra-inspired routing API on top of CocoaHTTPServer.

### [STHTTPRequest](https://github.com/nst/STHTTPRequest)
A NSURLSession wrapper for humans

### [asi-http-request](https://github.com/pokeb/asi-http-request)
ASIHTTPRequest is an easy to use wrapper around the **CFNetwork API** that makes some of the more tedious aspects of communicating with web servers easier. It is written in Objective-C and works in both Mac OS X and iPhone applications.

It is suitable performing basic HTTP requests and interacting with REST-based services (GET / POST / PUT / DELETE). The included ASIFormDataRequest subclass makes it easy to submit POST data and files using multipart/form-data.

### [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking)
A delightful networking framework for iOS, OS X, watchOS, and tvOS.

AFNetworking is a delightful networking library for iOS and Mac OS X. It's built on top of the [**Foundation URL Loading System**](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/URLLoadingSystem/URLLoadingSystem.html), extending the powerful high-level networking abstractions built into Cocoa. It has a modular architecture with well-designed, feature-rich APIs that are a joy to use.

#### [RestKit](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit)
RestKit is a modern Objective-C framework for implementing RESTful web services clients on iOS and Mac OS X. It provides a powerful object mapping engine that seamlessly integrates with Core Data and a simple set of networking primitives for mapping HTTP requests and responses built on top of [_**AFNetworking**_](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking). It has an elegant, carefully designed set of APIs that make accessing and modeling RESTful resources feel almost magical.
